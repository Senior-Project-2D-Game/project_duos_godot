## Background and Problem
The current gaming landscape does not seek to edify its users. Games today are growing more violent and more mechanical. There is less genuine care for the users and a greater concern with the amount of content churned out. 

## Brief Description of Solution Being Provided
Our game intends to bring players together by playing in a variety of levels where they explore opposites and try to see the world from different perspectives. We hope to help provide a meaningful experience for our users and to allow them to learn something that is not a niche fact or something to do with weapons, but instead wisdom that they can carry for a lifetime. 

## Research or Development Objective
This is a software development project. We used Godot (with our own elements built with Aseprite) to build the game. We also intend to run the game on a local server built on Nodejs. 

## Your Interest and Qualifications
All of us grew up on different forms of media, gaming, books, television, and film. We understand the impact that these forms of media have on people's lives (especially on children), and we know that without proper care, these media can harm people. We simply want people to experience what we experienced as kids. We want to inspire them and change them for the better. We all live together and intend to have weekly meetings and impromptu sessions to maintain the workflow. There is nothing that would prevent us from working the specified time. Members of the team have moderate skill-level in Godot, Aseprite and NodeJS.

## Collaboration with Advisor Outside Experts and Users
We will meet with our advisor every Friday at 12pm. We will have mix of students from different departments and different years to playtest our game. We would email them in a ‘raffle draw’ method.

## Dates and Milestones
-	First Demo-level completed by October 1st 
-	Testing commences by October 5th
-	Completed Multiplayer framework by December 1st
-	Completed second level by February 15th 
-	First complete user test by April 1st 

## User Goals
All game levels would require both players to rely on each other, quick-thinking and their overall creativity. To complete a given level, each player must complete tasks for the other player, but to complete certain tasks, the other user must have completed tasks in the first place. This system will cause users to be more cooperative and our challenging level design will enable creative problem-solving.
